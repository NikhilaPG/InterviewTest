# Welcome to my general c# knowledge test

*IMPORTANT*: Before you start, please create a branch from 'master' so you can commit onto your own branch

The code in the [BusinessLogic.cs](https://github.com/anthonymorin/InterviewTest/blob/master/InterviewTest/BusinessLogic.cs) page has various known issues.   
These could include, and may not be limited to:  
* stylistic problems
* redundancy
* bad practices
* antipatterns
* concurrency issues
* inefficiency
    
Running the current implementation, the output is not correct  
You should hopefully be able to infer what the correct output should be by assessing the current, incorrect output.

I would like you to refactor this code to make it as correct and readable as you can.

You should read the files in the DoNotEdit folder for context, but those classes should not be changed.

The following pages are a useful refresher for some of the issues in this code

 *Please commit your work on your own branch and push to the remote repo when you finish*
